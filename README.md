# Elliots_SQL_Projects - Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis

## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth is a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Task
I have been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. Use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

### Key Questions
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
